A Java Application for a basic shape drawing application
Implement a Student Record Management System with persistent storage using file handling and Java Collections Framework. The system should read student records from a file (students.txt) at the start of the application and save updated records back to the file upon exit. The records should be managed using collections like ArrayList or HashMap to store student information, and should be sorted by marks using Comparator. The system should allow for viewing, sorting, and displaying student data using Iterator. Additionally, implement file attributes using the File class and demonstrate reading records randomly using RandomAccessFile.
